# OperatingSystems

Syntax

The commands in Linux have the following syntax:

$command options arguments
The command is followed by options (optional of course) and a list of arguments. 
The options can modify the behavior of a command. The arguments may be files or directories or some other data on which the command acts.
Every command might not need arguments. Some commands work with or without them (e.g. ‘ls’ command).
The options can be provided in two ways: full word options with -- (e.g. --help), or single letter options with - (e.g. -a -b -c or multiple options, -abc).
